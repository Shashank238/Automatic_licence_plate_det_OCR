# Automatic licence plate detection with OCR

## üìå Introduction
This Machine Learning Web Application is used for capturing license plate of car using object detection algorithm and reads the license plate usin OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and return it to nosql Database like MongoDB. 
The dataset is obtained from webscraping google images for license plates , google open images dataset and few open source images.

This can also be used by traffic controlling team and capture the number plate of the cars those break the rules.
